- [ ] Slow test suite
- [ ] Test infrastructure improvement
- [ ] Test framework upgrade
- [ ] Test data management
- [ ] Test environment issues
- [ ] E2E/integration test gaps

## Current State

**What's the problem?**
<!-- Describe the current testing situation -->

**Current Test Coverage:**
<!-- If known, provide metrics -->
- Overall coverage: <!-- e.g., 65% -->
- Unit test coverage: <!-- e.g., 75% -->
- Integration test coverage: <!-- e.g., 40% -->
- E2E test coverage: <!-- e.g., 20% -->

**Coverage by Component:**
<!-- Which areas have good/poor coverage? -->
| Component | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Component A | 85% | ✅ Good |
| Component B | 45% | ⚠️ Needs work |
| Component C | 10% | ❌ Critical |

**Affected Components:**
<!-- Which parts of the codebase need testing improvements? -->
-

## Why This Matters

**Risks of Inadequate Testing:**
- [ ] Regressions introduced frequently
- [ ] Lack of confidence in refactoring
- [ ] Production bugs found by users
- [ ] Slow feedback on code quality
- [ ] Difficult to maintain codebase
- [ ] Blocked by manual testing bottleneck

**Recent Issues:**
<!-- Examples of bugs that could have been caught by tests -->
-

**Business Impact:**
<!-- How does poor testing affect the business? -->
- Production incidents
- User-reported bugs
- Slow release cycles
- Developer frustration
- Difficulty onboarding new developers

## Desired State

**Testing Goals:**
<!-- What should the testing look like? -->

**Target Coverage:**
- Overall coverage: <!-- e.g., 85% -->
- Unit test coverage: <!-- e.g., 90% -->
- Integration test coverage: <!-- e.g., 70% -->
- E2E test coverage: <!-- e.g., 50% critical paths -->

**Quality Metrics:**
- Test execution time: <!-- e.g., <5 minutes for unit, <30 min for all -->
- Flakiness rate: <!-- e.g., <1% flaky tests -->
- Test reliability: <!-- e.g., 99.5% pass rate for non-flaky tests -->

## Proposed Improvements

**Strategy:**
<!-- High-level approach to improving testing -->

**Specific Actions:**
1. <!-- e.g., Add unit tests for service layer -->
2. <!-- e.g., Implement integration tests for API endpoints -->
3. <!-- e.g., Add E2E tests for critical user flows -->
4. <!-- e.g., Fix flaky tests in authentication module -->

**Testing Pyramid:**
<!-- How should tests be distributed? -->
```
    E2E Tests (10%)
   /            \
  Integration Tests (30%)
 /                      \
Unit Tests (60%)
```

## Test Types to Add

**Unit Tests:**
<!-- Functions, classes, or modules needing unit tests -->
-

**Integration Tests:**
<!-- API endpoints, database interactions, service integrations -->
-

**End-to-End Tests:**
<!-- Critical user workflows to test -->
-

**Other Test Types:**
- [ ] Performance tests
- [ ] Security tests (fuzzing, penetration testing)
- [ ] Load/stress tests
- [ ] Accessibility tests
- [ ] Visual regression tests
- [ ] Contract tests (API consumers/providers)
- [ ] Smoke tests (deployment validation)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage goals met
- [ ] All critical paths have tests
- [ ] Flaky tests fixed or quarantined
- [ ] Test execution time acceptable
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integrated
- [ ] Test documentation updated
- [ ] Test data fixtures created
- [ ] Team trained on testing approach (if needed)
- [ ] Test maintenance process established

## Technical Context

**Test Framework:**
<!-- Current testing tools -->
- Unit testing: <!-- e.g., pytest, Jest, JUnit -->
- Integration testing: <!-- e.g., Supertest, TestContainers -->
- E2E testing: <!-- e.g., Playwright, Cypress, Selenium -->
- Mocking: <!-- e.g., unittest.mock, Sinon, Mockito -->
- Coverage tools: <!-- e.g., coverage.py, Istanbul, JaCoCo -->

**Test Environment:**
<!-- Where do tests run? -->
- CI/CD: <!-- e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI -->
- Local development: <!-- Docker Compose, local DB -->
- Test data: <!-- How is test data managed? -->

**Challenges:**
<!-- What makes testing difficult here? -->
- [ ] Complex setup/teardown
- [ ] External dependencies (APIs, databases)
- [ ] Async operations
- [ ] Authentication/authorization
- [ ] Time-dependent logic
- [ ] File system operations
- [ ] Random/non-deterministic behavior
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Test Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Critical Coverage**
<!-- Most important tests to add first -->
1.
2.
3.

**Phase 2: Breadth**
<!-- Expand coverage across codebase -->
1.
2.
3.

**Phase 3: Depth**
<!-- Edge cases, error conditions, performance -->
1.
2.
3.

**Test Data Strategy:**
<!-- How to manage test fixtures and data -->
- [ ] Factories/builders (e.g., factory_boy, Faker)
- [ ] Static fixtures
- [ ] Database seeds
- [ ] Mock data generators

## Flaky Test Strategy

<!-- If fixing flaky tests -->

**Flaky Tests Identified:**
<!-- List tests that fail intermittently -->
1. <!-- Test name - Failure rate: X% - Suspected cause -->
2.
3.

**Common Causes:**
- [ ] Race conditions / Timing issues
- [ ] External dependencies
- [ ] Shared state between tests
- [ ] Non-deterministic data
- [ ] Insufficient waits/timeouts
- [ ] Test order dependencies

**Remediation:**
- Add explicit waits instead of sleeps
- Isolate tests (avoid shared state)
- Mock external dependencies
- Use deterministic data/seeds
- Implement retry logic (as last resort)

## Performance Optimization

<!-- If addressing slow tests -->

**Current Test Performance:**
- Total test suite time: <!-- e.g., 45 minutes -->
- Slowest tests: <!-- List top 5 slow tests -->

**Optimization Strategies:**
- [ ] Parallelize test execution
- [ ] Use test database transactions (rollback instead of recreate)
- [ ] Optimize test data setup
- [ ] Mock expensive operations
- [ ] Split test suite (fast/slow)
- [ ] Use test containers with reuse

**Target Performance:**
- Total test suite time: <!-- e.g., <10 minutes -->

## Additional Context

**Related Issues:**
<!-- Links to bugs that lack tests, refactoring that needs tests -->

**References:**
<!-- Links to testing best practices, frameworks, or articles -->
-

**Examples from Other Projects:**
<!-- Good testing practices to emulate -->

## Priority

**Priority:** <!-- Critical | High | Medium | Low -->

**Justification:**
<!-- Why this priority? Consider: production bugs, release confidence, developer velocity -->

## Estimated Effort

**Effort:** <!-- XS (<2h) | S (2-4h) | M (4-8h) | L (8-16h) | XL (16-32h) | XXL (>32h) -->

**Breakdown:**
- Test infrastructure setup: <!-- estimate -->
- Writing tests: <!-- estimate -->
- Fixing flaky tests: <!-- estimate -->
- Documentation: <!-- estimate -->

**Complexity:**
- [ ] Simple - Straightforward unit tests
- [ ] Moderate - Integration tests, some mocking
- [ ] Complex - E2E tests, infrastructure changes

**Additional Notes:**
<!-- Any other context or testing philosophy -->

**Testing Principles:**
> - Tests should be fast, isolated, repeatable, self-checking, and timely (FIRST)
> - Test behavior, not implementation
> - Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA pattern)
