## Infrastructure Change Description

**What infrastructure change is needed?**
<!-- Clearly describe the infrastructure change or improvement -->

**Type of infrastructure change:**
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (build, test, deploy automation)
- [ ] Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- [ ] Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- [ ] Deployment process
- [ ] Monitoring and observability
- [ ] Logging infrastructure
- [ ] Networking (load balancers, DNS, CDN)
- [ ] Database infrastructure
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Scaling/auto-scaling
- [ ] Security infrastructure (WAF, VPN, etc.)
- [ ] Development environment
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Current State

**Current Infrastructure:**
<!-- Describe the current setup -->

**Problems with Current Setup:**
<!-- What issues exist? -->
- [ ] Manual processes prone to errors
- [ ] Slow deployment cycles
- [ ] Difficult to scale
- [ ] Poor reliability/uptime
- [ ] Lack of monitoring/visibility
- [ ] Security concerns
- [ ] High operational costs
- [ ] Difficult to maintain
- [ ] Inconsistent environments (dev/staging/prod)

**Pain Points:**
<!-- Specific examples of problems -->
-

## Desired State

**Proposed Infrastructure:**
<!-- Describe the improved infrastructure -->

**Benefits:**
- **Reliability:** <!-- Improved uptime, fault tolerance -->
- **Scalability:** <!-- Better handling of load, auto-scaling -->
- **Performance:** <!-- Reduced latency, better throughput -->
- **Security:** <!-- Enhanced security posture -->
- **Cost:** <!-- Cost reduction or optimization -->
- **Developer Experience:** <!-- Easier deployments, faster feedback -->
- **Observability:** <!-- Better monitoring, logging, alerting -->

## Technical Design

**Architecture Diagram:**
<!-- If applicable, describe or link to architecture diagram -->
```
Current:    [Description or ASCII diagram]

Proposed:   [Description or ASCII diagram]
```

**Components:**
<!-- List infrastructure components -->
1. <!-- e.g., Kubernetes cluster with 3 worker nodes -->
2. <!-- e.g., RDS PostgreSQL with read replicas -->
3. <!-- e.g., CloudFront CDN for static assets -->

**Technology Stack:**
<!-- Infrastructure tools and services -->
- Platform: <!-- e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem -->
- Orchestration: <!-- e.g., Kubernetes, ECS, Docker Swarm -->
- CI/CD: <!-- e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI -->
- IaC: <!-- e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi -->
- Monitoring: <!-- e.g., Prometheus, DataDog, New Relic -->
- Logging: <!-- e.g., ELK Stack, CloudWatch, Splunk -->

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Planning and Design**
- [ ] Architecture design completed
- [ ] Cost analysis performed
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Capacity planning done
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

**Phase 2: Development/Setup**
- [ ] Infrastructure code written (Terraform, etc.)
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting set up
- [ ] Documentation created
- [ ] Testing environment configured

**Phase 3: Testing and Validation**
- [ ] Infrastructure tested in non-production
- [ ] Load testing performed
- [ ] Failover/disaster recovery tested
- [ ] Security scanning completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

**Phase 4: Rollout**
- [ ] Deployment to staging
- [ ] Smoke tests passed
- [ ] Deployment to production
- [ ] Production validation
- [ ] Monitoring confirms health

**Phase 5: Post-Deployment**
- [ ] Documentation finalized
- [ ] Team training completed
- [ ] Old infrastructure decommissioned (if applicable)
- [ ] Post-mortem/retrospective held

## Migration Strategy

<!-- If migrating from existing infrastructure -->

**Migration Approach:**
- [ ] Big bang (all at once)
- [ ] Blue-green deployment
- [ ] Canary deployment (gradual rollout)
- [ ] Parallel run (old and new simultaneously)

**Migration Steps:**
1.
2.
3.

**Data Migration:**
<!-- If applicable -->
- Strategy: <!-- e.g., database replication, ETL -->
- Downtime required: <!-- e.g., None, 1 hour maintenance window -->
- Rollback procedure: <!-- How to revert if needed -->

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Infrastructure provisioned and operational
- [ ] All services running on new infrastructure
- [ ] Performance requirements met or exceeded
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting functional
- [ ] Disaster recovery tested
- [ ] Security requirements met
- [ ] Documentation complete (architecture, runbooks, troubleshooting)
- [ ] Team trained on new infrastructure
- [ ] Cost targets achieved
- [ ] Old infrastructure decommissioned (if applicable)

## Operational Considerations

**Monitoring and Alerting:**
<!-- What will be monitored? -->
- Metrics: <!-- CPU, memory, disk, network, custom metrics -->
- Alerts: <!-- What triggers alerts? Who gets notified? -->
- Dashboards: <!-- What dashboards will be created? -->

**Maintenance:**
<!-- Ongoing maintenance requirements -->
- Backup schedule: <!-- e.g., Daily backups with 30-day retention -->
- Update cadence: <!-- e.g., Security patches weekly, upgrades quarterly -->
- On-call requirements: <!-- Who handles incidents? -->

**Cost Management:**
<!-- Cost considerations -->
- Estimated monthly cost: <!-- e.g., $500/month -->
- Cost optimization strategies: <!-- Reserved instances, spot instances, etc. -->
- Budget alerts: <!-- Alerts if cost exceeds threshold -->

**Security:**
<!-- Security measures -->
- Access control: <!-- IAM roles, RBAC -->
- Network security: <!-- VPC, security groups, firewalls -->
- Data encryption: <!-- At rest and in transit -->
- Secrets management: <!-- Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc. -->
- Compliance: <!-- HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS, etc. -->

## Risks and Mitigation

**Potential Risks:**
1. <!-- Risk 1 - Likelihood: High/Medium/Low -->
   - **Mitigation:** <!-- How to prevent or address -->
2. <!-- Risk 2 -->
   - **Mitigation:**
3. <!-- Risk 3 -->
   - **Mitigation:**

**Rollback Plan:**
<!-- Detailed steps to rollback if deployment fails -->
1.
2.
3.

**Success Metrics:**
<!-- How to determine if the change was successful? -->
- Uptime: <!-- e.g., 99.9% SLA -->
- Deployment frequency: <!-- e.g., 10 deployments/day -->
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR): <!-- e.g., <15 minutes -->
- Change failure rate: <!-- e.g., <5% -->
