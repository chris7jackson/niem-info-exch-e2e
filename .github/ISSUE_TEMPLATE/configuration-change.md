## Configuration Change Description

**What configuration needs to change?**
<!-- Clearly describe the configuration change -->

**Type of configuration:**
- [ ] Environment variables
- [ ] Application config files (JSON, YAML, XML, INI, etc.)
- [ ] Build configuration (Webpack, Vite, Gradle, Maven, etc.)
- [ ] Runtime configuration (JVM options, Node flags, etc.)
- [ ] Feature flags / Toggles
- [ ] Database configuration
- [ ] Logging configuration
- [ ] Security configuration (CORS, CSP, SSL/TLS)
- [ ] Third-party service configuration (API keys, endpoints)
- [ ] Infrastructure configuration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Motivation

**Why is this configuration change needed?**
<!-- Describe the problem or opportunity -->

**Current Behavior:**
<!-- How does the system behave with current configuration? -->

**Desired Behavior:**
<!-- How should the system behave after configuration change? -->

## Current Configuration

**Current Settings:**
<!-- Show current configuration (redact sensitive values) -->
```yaml
# Current configuration
# e.g., config/settings.yaml
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  pool_size: 10
```

**Location:**
<!-- Where is this configuration defined? -->
- File: <!-- e.g., config/production.yaml -->
- Environment: <!-- e.g., .env, Kubernetes ConfigMap, AWS Parameter Store -->
- Scope: <!-- e.g., global, per-environment, per-service -->

## Proposed Configuration

**New Settings:**
<!-- Show proposed configuration (redact sensitive values) -->
```yaml
# Proposed configuration
database:
  host: db.example.com
  port: 5432
  pool_size: 20  # Increased for better concurrency
  timeout: 30s    # Added timeout
```

**Changes Summary:**
<!-- List specific changes -->
1. <!-- e.g., Increase pool_size from 10 to 20 -->
2. <!-- e.g., Add timeout setting of 30s -->
3.

**Default Values:**
<!-- If adding new config, what are the defaults? -->

## Impact Analysis

**What will be affected?**
- [ ] Application behavior
- [ ] Performance (positive/negative)
- [ ] Security posture
- [ ] External integrations
- [ ] Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- [ ] User experience
- [ ] Logging/monitoring output
- [ ] Cost (infrastructure, third-party services)

**Specific Impacts:**
<!-- Describe expected impacts -->
-

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- [ ] Fully compatible - No issues
- [ ] Requires graceful migration
- [ ] Breaking change - Requires careful coordination

## Environment Considerations

**Which environments need this change?**
- [ ] Development
- [ ] Testing/QA
- [ ] Staging
- [ ] Production
- [ ] All environments

**Environment-Specific Values:**
<!-- If configuration differs by environment -->
| Environment | Setting | Value |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Development | pool_size | 5 |
| Staging | pool_size | 15 |
| Production | pool_size | 20 |

## Security Considerations

**Sensitive Information:**
<!-- Does this configuration contain secrets? -->
- [ ] No sensitive data
- [ ] Contains secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] Contains PII or regulated data

**Secret Management:**
<!-- If sensitive data, how will it be managed? -->
- [ ] Environment variables
- [ ] Secret management system (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- [ ] Encrypted configuration file
- [ ] Kubernetes Secrets

**Security Impact:**
<!-- Does this change affect security? -->
- [ ] Improves security
- [ ] No security impact
- [ ] Potential security risk (explain mitigation):

## Validation and Testing

**How to validate this change?**
<!-- Testing approach -->
- [ ] Unit tests updated
- [ ] Integration tests updated
- [ ] Configuration schema validation
- [ ] Smoke tests in staging
- [ ] Monitoring confirms expected behavior
- [ ] Manual verification steps:
  1.
  2.
  3.

**Success Criteria:**
<!-- How do we know the change worked? -->
-

**Rollback Plan:**
<!-- How to revert if issues occur? -->
1.
2.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Configuration changes implemented in all target environments
- [ ] Configuration validated (schema, syntax)
- [ ] Application starts successfully with new configuration
- [ ] Expected behavior verified in staging
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Monitoring confirms healthy state
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team notified of configuration changes
- [ ] Old configuration archived (if needed)

## Implementation Plan

**Deployment Steps:**
<!-- How to deploy this configuration change -->
1. <!-- e.g., Update configuration in version control -->
2. <!-- e.g., Deploy to staging and verify -->
3. <!-- e.g., Update production configuration -->
4. <!-- e.g., Restart services or reload configuration -->
5. <!-- e.g., Verify in production -->

**Deployment Timing:**
<!-- When should this be deployed? -->
- [ ] Anytime (no impact)
- [ ] During low-traffic period
- [ ] Requires maintenance window
- [ ] Coordinate with other deployments

**Restart Required:**
<!-- Does the application need to restart? -->
- [ ] No - Hot reload supported
- [ ] Yes - Restart required
- [ ] Partial - Some services need restart

**Migration Required:**
<!-- Does this require data migration? -->
- [ ] No migration needed
- [ ] Migration required: <!-- describe -->

## Configuration Management

**Version Control:**
<!-- How is configuration version controlled? -->
- [ ] In application repository
- [ ] Separate configuration repository
- [ ] Configuration management tool (Ansible, Chef, Puppet)
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)

**Configuration Format:**
<!-- What format is the configuration? -->
- Format: <!-- e.g., YAML, JSON, TOML, .env -->
- Validation: <!-- e.g., JSON Schema, custom validator -->

**Documentation:**
<!-- Where is configuration documented? -->
- [ ] Inline comments in config file
- [ ] README or separate documentation
- [ ] Wiki or knowledge base
- [ ] No documentation (needs to be created)

## Monitoring and Alerting

**Configuration Monitoring:**
<!-- How to monitor configuration health? -->
- [ ] Application health checks
- [ ] Configuration drift detection
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Error rates

**Alerts:**
<!-- Are new alerts needed? -->
- [ ] No alerts needed
- [ ] Update existing alerts
- [ ] Create new alerts: <!-- describe -->

## Dependencies

<!-- Links to related issues or features -->
-

**References:**
<!-- Links to documentation, vendor guides, or research -->
-

**Historical Context:**
<!-- Why was the current configuration chosen? What changed? -->

**Team Impact:**

- [ ] Documentation update required

## Priority

**Priority:** <!-- Critical | High | Medium | Low -->

**Justification:**
<!-- Why this priority? Consider: impact, urgency, risk -->

## Estimated Effort

**Effort:** <!-- XS (<2h) | S (2-4h) | M (4-8h) | L (8-16h) | XL (16-32h) | XXL (>32h) -->

**Breakdown:**
- Configuration changes: <!-- estimate -->
- Testing and validation: <!-- estimate -->
- Deployment: <!-- estimate -->
- Documentation: <!-- estimate -->

**Complexity:**
- [ ] Simple - Single config file, clear change
- [ ] Moderate - Multiple files or environments
- [ ] Complex - Requires coordination, migration, or careful rollout

---

**Configuration Best Practices:**
> - Use environment variables for environment-specific settings
> - Never commit secrets to version control
> - Document all configuration options
> - Provide sensible defaults
> - Validate configuration at startup
> - Use configuration schemas where possible

**Additional Notes:**
