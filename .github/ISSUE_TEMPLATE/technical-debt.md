## Technical Debt Description

**What needs to be improved?**
<!-- Clearly describe the technical debt -->

**Type of technical debt:**
- [ ] Code quality (readability, maintainability)
- [ ] Architecture / Design patterns
- [ ] Code duplication (DRY violations)
- [ ] Outdated patterns or practices
- [ ] Missing abstractions
- [ ] Complex/tangled dependencies
- [ ] Insufficient error handling
- [ ] Hard-coded values / Magic numbers
- [ ] Inadequate logging or monitoring
- [ ] Missing or outdated tests
- [ ] Temporary workarounds that became permanent
- [ ] Legacy code from rapid prototyping
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Current State

**Problematic Code/Pattern:**
<!-- Describe current implementation -->

**Location:**
<!-- Which files, modules, or components? -->
-

**How did this debt accumulate?**
<!-- Common reasons: tight deadlines, changing requirements, learning curve, etc. -->

**Code Example:**
<!-- If applicable, show a simplified example of the problematic code -->
```python
# Current implementation
```

## Why This Matters

**Impact on Development:**
- [ ] Slows down new feature development
- [ ] Makes bugs more likely
- [ ] Difficult to onboard new developers
- [ ] Painful to modify or extend
- [ ] Increases testing difficulty
- [ ] Causes production issues
- [ ] Creates security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Other: ___________

**Pain Points:**
<!-- Specific examples of how this causes problems -->
-

**Velocity Impact:**
<!-- How much does this slow down development? -->
- [ ] Major blocker - Every change to this area is difficult
- [ ] Significant - Frequently causes issues
- [ ] Moderate - Occasional friction
- [ ] Minor - Rare inconvenience

## Proposed Refactoring

**Desired State:**
<!-- Describe the improved design or code structure -->

**Refactoring Approach:**
<!-- High-level strategy -->
1.
2.
3.

**Design Patterns to Apply:**
<!-- If applicable -->
-

**Better Code Example:**
<!-- If applicable, show what the refactored code might look like -->
```python
# Refactored implementation
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
<!-- Other refactoring approaches? Trade-offs? -->

## Benefits

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- [ ] Better readability
- [ ] Improved maintainability
- [ ] Reduced complexity
- [ ] Better testability
- [ ] Clearer separation of concerns
- [ ] More consistent with project conventions
- [ ] Easier to extend

**Developer Experience:**
<!-- How will this make developers' lives better? -->
-

**Long-term Value:**
<!-- Strategic benefits of addressing this debt -->
-

## Risks and Considerations

**Refactoring Risks:**
- [ ] High risk - Core functionality, many dependencies
- [ ] Medium risk - Important but isolated
- [ ] Low risk - Small scope, well-tested

**Mitigation Strategy:**
<!-- How to reduce refactoring risks? -->
- Comprehensive test coverage before refactoring
- Incremental changes with frequent commits
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Pair programming or code review
- Rollback plan

**Backward Compatibility:**
- [ ] Fully compatible - No API changes
- [ ] Minor breaking changes - Can be mitigated
- [ ] Major breaking changes - Requires careful planning

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Code refactored according to plan
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] New tests added for previously untested code
- [ ] Code complexity metrics improved (if measured)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] No regressions in functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new structure
- [ ] Team knowledge transfer completed (if significant changes)

## Technical Context

**Affected Areas:**
<!-- Components, modules, or services affected -->
-

**Dependencies:**
<!-- Code that depends on the area being refactored -->
-

**Testing Strategy:**
<!-- How to ensure refactoring doesn't break things? -->
- Existing test coverage: <!-- e.g., 75% -->
- Additional tests needed: <!-- Unit, integration, e2e -->
- Manual testing required: <!-- Specific scenarios -->

**Code Metrics:**
<!-- If applicable, current vs target metrics -->
- Cyclomatic complexity:
- Lines of code:
- Code duplication:
- Test coverage:

## Implementation Plan

**Incremental Steps:**
<!-- Break refactoring into safe, reviewable steps -->
1. <!-- Step 1: e.g., Add comprehensive tests -->
2. <!-- Step 2: e.g., Extract method/class -->
3. <!-- Step 3: e.g., Update callers -->
4. <!-- Step 4: e.g., Remove old code -->

**Rollout Strategy:**
- [ ] All at once (small, low-risk refactoring)
- [ ] Incremental (medium-risk, multiple PRs)
- [ ] Parallel implementation (high-risk, gradual migration)

## Additional Context

**Related Technical Debt:**
<!-- Other related refactoring opportunities -->
-

**Historical Context:**
<!-- When was this code written? Why was it done this way? -->

**Team Impact:**
<!-- Will this require team training or documentation? -->

**References:**
<!-- Links to design docs, architecture discussions, or best practices -->
-

## Priority

**Priority:** <!-- Critical | High | Medium | Low -->

**Justification:**
<!-- Why prioritize this debt over others? Consider: impact, frequency, risk -->

**Urgency vs Importance Matrix:**
- [ ] Urgent & Important - Do now (blocking development)
- [ ] Important but not Urgent - Schedule (should be fixed soon)
- [ ] Urgent but not Important - Quick fix (workaround acceptable)
- [ ] Neither Urgent nor Important - Backlog (nice to have)

## Estimated Effort

**Effort:** <!-- XS (<2h) | S (2-4h) | M (4-8h) | L (8-16h) | XL (16-32h) | XXL (>32h) -->

**Breakdown:**
- Analysis and planning: <!-- estimate -->
- Refactoring implementation: <!-- estimate -->
- Testing and validation: <!-- estimate -->
- Code review: <!-- estimate -->
- Documentation: <!-- estimate -->

**Complexity:**
- [ ] Simple - Localized changes, clear approach
- [ ] Moderate - Multiple files, some uncertainty
- [ ] Complex - Architecture changes, high risk
