## Performance Issue

**Type of performance issue:**
- [ ] Slow response time / High latency
- [ ] Low throughput / Poor scalability
- [ ] High resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- [ ] Inefficient algorithm or query
- [ ] Memory leak
- [ ] N+1 query problem
- [ ] Excessive I/O operations
- [ ] Poor caching strategy
- [ ] Database bottleneck
- [ ] Network bottleneck

## Current Performance

**Observed Behavior:**
<!-- Describe the performance problem -->

**Metrics:**
<!-- Provide measurable data -->
- **Response time:** <!-- e.g., 2.5s average, 5s p95, 8s p99 -->
- **Throughput:** <!-- e.g., 100 requests/second -->
- **CPU usage:** <!-- e.g., 80% average, spikes to 100% -->
- **Memory usage:** <!-- e.g., 2GB steady state, leaks 100MB/hour -->
- **Database query time:** <!-- e.g., 500ms average -->
- **Error rate:** <!-- e.g., 2% timeout errors -->

**Measurement Method:**
<!-- How were these metrics collected? -->
- Tool: <!-- e.g., New Relic, DataDog, custom logging, profiler -->
- Environment: <!-- e.g., production, staging, local -->
- Load: <!-- e.g., 1000 concurrent users, batch of 10k records -->
- Date/Time: <!-- When was this measured? -->

**Affected Endpoints/Components:**
<!-- Which parts of the system are slow? -->
-

## Target Performance

**Performance Goals:**
<!-- What are the target metrics? -->
- **Response time:** <!-- e.g., <500ms average, <1s p95, <2s p99 -->
- **Throughput:** <!-- e.g., 500 requests/second -->
- **CPU usage:** <!-- e.g., <50% average -->
- **Memory usage:** <!-- e.g., <1GB steady state, no leaks -->
- **Database query time:** <!-- e.g., <100ms average -->
- **Error rate:** <!-- e.g., <0.1% -->

**Success Criteria:**
<!-- How much improvement is needed? -->
- [ ] 2x faster
- [ ] 5x faster
- [ ] 10x faster
- [ ] Reduce resource usage by 50%

## Root Cause Analysis

**Suspected Bottleneck:**
<!-- What do you think is causing the performance issue? -->

**Profiling Data:**
<!-- If available, include profiler output, flame graphs, or query execution plans -->
```
# Profiler output, slow query logs, etc.
```

**Contributing Factors:**

- [ ] Missing database indexes
- [ ] Lack of caching
- [ ] Too many database queries (N+1 problem)
- [ ] Large payload sizes
- [ ] Synchronous operations that could be async
- [ ] Memory allocation/garbage collection
- [ ] Network latency
- [ ] Third-party service delays
- [ ] Resource contention
- [ ] Other: ___________

2. <!-- e.g., Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data -->
3. <!-- e.g., Replace nested loops with hash map lookup -->

**Alternatives Considered:**
<!-- What other approaches were evaluated? Trade-offs? -->

**Trade-offs:**
<!-- Any downsides? Increased complexity, storage, etc.? -->

## Technical Context

- [ ] Profiling (e.g., py-spy, perf, Chrome DevTools)
- [ ] APM tools (e.g., New Relic, DataDog, Dynatrace)
- [ ] Custom metrics and logging
- [ ] Database query analysis (EXPLAIN plans)

**Test Scenarios:**
<!-- Define test cases to validate improvement -->
1. Baseline test: <!-- Current performance -->
2. Optimized test: <!-- Expected performance after changes -->
3. Stress test: <!-- Performance under extreme load -->
