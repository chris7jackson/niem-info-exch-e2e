# TDR-001: defusedxml for Secure XML Parsing

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The NIEM Information Exchange system processes untrusted XML content from multiple sources:
- **Schema Upload**: User-uploaded NIEM XSD schema files
- **XML Ingestion**: User-uploaded NIEM XML instance documents
- **CMF Processing**: Common Model Format XML files
- **Schematron Validation**: SVRL (Schematron Validation Report Language) XML output
- **XML-to-JSON Conversion**: Arbitrary NIEM XML messages

### Security Vulnerability

Python's standard `xml.etree.ElementTree` module is vulnerable to several XML-based attacks when parsing untrusted content:

1. **XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks** (CWE-611)
   - Allows attackers to read arbitrary files from the server
   - Can trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks
   - Enables denial of service through entity expansion

2. **Billion Laughs Attack** (XML Bomb)
   - Nested entity expansion can consume excessive memory
   - Leads to denial of service

3. **Quadratic Blowup**
   - Pathological XML structures cause exponential processing time
   - Another form of denial of service

### Bandit Security Scan Findings

Static analysis with Bandit flagged 12 instances of `xml.etree.ElementTree` usage:
```
>> Issue: [B314:blacklist] Using xml.etree.ElementTree.fromstring to parse
   untrusted XML data is known to be vulnerable to XML attacks.
   Severity: Medium   Confidence: High
```

**Affected Files:**
- `src/niem_api/handlers/schema.py` (2 occurrences)
- `src/niem_api/services/domain/schema/mapping.py` (2 occurrences)
- `src/niem_api/services/domain/schema/resolver.py` (4 occurrences)
- `src/niem_api/services/domain/schema/validator.py` (2 occurrences)
- `src/niem_api/services/domain/xml_to_graph/converter.py` (1 occurrence)

### Current Risk

All XML parsing in the application handles **user-provided, untrusted content**. Without protection:
- Schema upload endpoints are vulnerable to XXE attacks
- XML ingestion could be exploited for file disclosure
- Processing malicious XML could cause service disruption

## Decision

**Adopt `defusedxml` as the standard XML parsing library for all untrusted XML content.**

### Implementation Approach

Replace all instances of:
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
```

With the secure alternative:
```python
import defusedxml.ElementTree as ET
```

This is a **drop-in replacement** with identical API, requiring no code changes beyond the import statement.

### Why defusedxml?

**1. Drop-in Compatibility**
- Identical API to standard library `xml.etree.ElementTree`
- No refactoring of existing parsing logic required
- Minimal migration effort

**2. Comprehensive Protection**
- Prevents XXE attacks by disabling external entity resolution
- Limits entity expansion to prevent billion laughs attacks
- Protects against quadratic blowup attacks
- Configurable safety limits for DTD processing

**3. Industry Standard**
- Maintained by Christian Heimes (Python core developer)
- Widely adopted in security-conscious Python applications
- Recommended by OWASP and Python security best practices
- Active maintenance and security updates

**4. Zero Performance Impact**
- Same underlying C-accelerated XML parser (expat)
- Security restrictions add negligible overhead
- No measurable performance degradation in benchmarks

**5. Lightweight Dependency**
- Pure Python library with no additional dependencies
- Small package size (~50KB)
- Minimal impact on Docker image size

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Security Hardening**
- Eliminates all XXE vulnerabilities in XML processing
- Prevents denial of service via malicious XML structures
- Reduces attack surface for user-provided content

✅ **Compliance**
- Resolves all Bandit B314 security warnings
- Aligns with OWASP XML security recommendations
- Meets security requirements for handling untrusted data

✅ **Maintainability**
- Drop-in replacement requires minimal code changes
- Future XML parsing automatically inherits protections
- Clear import statement signals security intent

✅ **Zero Breaking Changes**
- Identical API to standard library
- All existing tests pass without modification
- No changes to application behavior for legitimate XML

### Negative

⚠️ **Additional Dependency**
- Adds one more external library to requirements.txt
- Increases Docker image size by ~50KB (negligible)
- Requires security updates for defusedxml itself

⚠️ **Potential Edge Cases**
- Legitimate XML with external entities will be rejected
- DTD processing is restricted by default
- May break if future code relies on unsafe XML features

### Mitigation

**Dependency Management:**
- Pin defusedxml version in requirements.txt
- Monitor for security advisories via Dependabot
- Include in CI/CD dependency scanning (already configured)

**Documentation:**
- Add comment at each import: `# Use defusedxml for secure XML parsing`
- Document XML parsing security in API_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Include in developer onboarding materials

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Continue Using xml.etree.ElementTree with Manual Hardening

**Approach:** Configure XML parser to disable dangerous features:
```python
parser = ET.XMLParser()
parser.entity = {}  # Disable entity expansion
parser.resolve_entities = False  # Disable external entities
```

**Rejected Because:**
- Requires manual configuration at every parse site
- Error-prone (easy to forget in new code)
- Incomplete protection (misses some attack vectors)
- More code to maintain and audit

### 2. Use lxml with Security Features

**Approach:** Switch to lxml and enable security options:
```python
from lxml import etree
parser = etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False, no_network=True)
```

**Rejected Because:**
- Requires C library dependencies (libxml2, libxslt)
- Larger Docker image (~5MB increase)
- Different API requires code refactoring
- Overkill for our XML processing needs (we don't need XSLT)

### 3. Suppress Bandit Warnings with # nosec

**Approach:** Add `# nosec B314` comments to suppress warnings without fixing:
```python
root = ET.fromstring(xml_content)  # nosec B314
```

**Rejected Because:**
- Ignores real security vulnerabilities
- Provides no actual protection
- Bad security practice (hiding issues instead of fixing)
- False sense of security

### 4. Input Validation and Sanitization

**Approach:** Validate and sanitize XML before parsing:
```python
# Check for entity declarations, external references, etc.
if "<!ENTITY" in xml_content or "<!DOCTYPE" in xml_content:
    raise ValueError("Potentially malicious XML")
```

**Rejected Because:**
- Blacklist approach is inherently incomplete
- Attackers can find bypass techniques
- Adds complexity and potential bugs
- defusedxml provides better, tested protection
