# UI Migrations

This directory will contain UI-related migrations and upgrade procedures.

## Status

**Not Active During Prerelease (0.x.y)**

Migration tooling is stubbed but not active during the prerelease phase. Breaking changes are allowed in 0.x.y versions.

## Future Implementation (1.0.0+)

When the UI reaches version 1.0.0, this directory will contain:

### LocalStorage Migrations
- Scripts to migrate browser localStorage schemas
- Version upgrade procedures
- Data format transformations

### State Management Migrations
- Updates to application state structure
- Redux/context migrations (if applicable)
- Cache invalidation strategies

### Configuration Migrations
- User preferences migrations
- Settings schema changes
- Feature flag transitions

### Example Migration:
```typescript
// 001_migrate_local_storage.ts
export function migrateLocalStorage(currentVersion: string) {
  if (currentVersion < '1.0.0') {
    // Migrate old schema to new schema
    const oldData = localStorage.getItem('old_key');
    if (oldData) {
      const newData = transform(oldData);
      localStorage.setItem('new_key', newData);
      localStorage.removeItem('old_key');
    }
  }
}
```

## Migration Triggers

Migrations may run:
- On application load (version check)
- On user login
- On specific user actions
- Via admin panel
